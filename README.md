# EPFL Fall 2020 Experience Design Project - The Better Cuddler

Have you missed the warm feeling of embracing your loved ones during confinement? Research shows that physical touch, and longing for it, is part of being human. When we are deprived of touch, stress and depression levels rise. With The Better Cuddler, you can feel the warm and soft embrace of your loved ones from afar. The device comes in the shape of a disk, which you can insert into your favorite pillow. It lights up and/or vibrates, whenever your loved one is hugging their pillow. Its integrated lighting enables your to feel the presence of your loved ones while its heater enables you to feel their warm embrace from across the world.

Received 3rd best project award in class.
